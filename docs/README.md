# Overview

This library is a repository of PowerShell scripts designed for use by my fellow **Managed Service Providers** (MSPs) to automate tasks and manage client devices.&#x20;

Included with each script is a description of what it does and links to useful documentation.

Ultimately, this serves as a place for me to work on my PowerShell scripting and documentation writing in a way that gives back to the community.
