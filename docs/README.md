# Overview

This library is a repository of PowerShell scripts designed for use by my fellow **Managed Service Providers** (MSPs), primarily geared towards smaller MSPs (including one-person shops).

**Each Script Page Includes:**

* An overview of the script
* Prerequisites to running the script, if applicable
* Documentation for cmdlets, products, etc. used in the script

Ultimately, this library serves as a place for me to give back to the community while also working on self-improvement in various skillsets and product knowledge.

Scripts shared with :heart: by [**Red Letter Tech, LLC**](https://redletter.tech).
