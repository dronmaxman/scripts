  used by MSPs to automate tasks and manage client devices.

# Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
**Disclaimer:** While scripts in this library are designed to be RMM agnostic, they are only tested locally and from my current RMM platform, [**NinjaOne**](https://www.ninjaone.com).
{% endhint %}

This library is a repository of PowerShell scripts designed for use by my fellow **IT Managed Service Providers** (MSPs), primarily geared towards smaller MSPs (including one-person shops).

**Each Script Page Includes:**

* An overview of the script
* Prerequisites to running the script, if applicable
* Documentation for cmdlets, products, etc. used in the script

Ultimately, this library serves as a place for me to give back to the community while also working on self-improvement in various skillsets and product knowledge.

**Notes:**

PowerShell scripts included in this library are built for and tested against **Windows 10 or later**, which include **PowerShell 5.1**. Earlier versions of Windows / PowerShell will be missing cmdlets, such as `Invoke-WebRequest`, that were introduced in later versions.

Scripts shared with :heart: by [**Red Letter Tech, LLC**](https://redletter.tech).
