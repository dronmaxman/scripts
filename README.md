# Shared Script Library

This library is a repository of PowerShell scripts designed for use by my fellow IT Managed Service Providers (MSPs), primarily geared towards smaller MSPs (including one-person shops). They may be beneficial to internal IT teams as well.

Documentation for scripts is located at https://scripts.redletter.tech.
